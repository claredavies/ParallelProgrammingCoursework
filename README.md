# ParallelProgrammingCoursework

Do galaxies in the universe bunch together, or are they randomly distributed? For this, the following have to be calculated: the angles between all real galaxies, 
the angles between all real and all synthetic galaxies and finally the angles between all synthetic galaxies. 
After this histograms are drawn of the three angle distributions and based on these we can decide whether the two galaxy distributions are the same or different.

This problem was parallised in 3 different ways:
  1) OpenMP
  2) MPI
  3) CUDA
